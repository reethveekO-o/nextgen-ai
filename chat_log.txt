 Hey buddy, sounds like you have a lot going on! It seems you have some decisions to make, but remember it's okay to prioritize yourself and your interests. For the game club, it might be good to meet with Sumit first to get a better idea before making a decision. As for the MUN and DW, it looks like both are important to you, so try to balance them out. And no worries about filling in preferences or RSVPs, I'm here to remind you! ðŸ˜Š Keep me posted on what you decide! Oh, and about Toofy, I'm not sure if we know them personally, but I can help you find more info if needed!
